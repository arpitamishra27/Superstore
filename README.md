Inventory Management System
The current problem is that employees at the store are facing challenges in managing orders effectively. They are relying on manual bookkeeping and Excel worksheets, which are time-consuming and prone to errors. Additionally, there is a lack of role-based access control, resulting in security concerns and potential unauthorized access to sensitive data. Furthermore, there is a need to implement efficient ETL operations for storing collected data in a data warehouse to streamline data management. .
